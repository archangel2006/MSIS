# Market Shock Intelligence System (MSIS)

A market intelligence web application that uses machine learning to analyze historical financial data and explain how market risk, volatility, and model behavior change across different market conditions.

---

## 🚩 Problem 

Financial markets generate massive amounts of data, but during periods of stress, understanding *market behavior* and *risk dynamics* is often more valuable than point price predictions.

Traditional ML models often:
- Treat all market periods as identical
- Break down during crises
- Offer little explanation of risk behavior

This project focuses on **quantifying market regimes** and understanding **when and why markets behave differently**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an explainable market intelligence system that:
- Identifies different market regimes (calm, stressed, crisis)
- Analyzes regime transitions and volatility buildup
- Evaluates how models and strategies perform across regimes
- Emphasizes interpretation over raw prediction accuracy

## 🏗️ System Design

MSIS is built as a **decoupled analytics system**:

```
Offline Analysis Engine (Python)
│
├─ Data ingestion
├─ Feature computation
├─ Regime detection
└─ Stress & robustness analysis
        ↓
Precomputed Outputs
│
├─ CSV files
└─ JSON files
        ↓
Backend API (FastAPI)
│
├─ Reads computed results
└─ Exposes insight endpoints
        ↓
Frontend Dashboard (Next.js)
│
├─ Interactive charts
├─ Regime exploration
└─ Insight explanation
```

## ❓ Key Questions We Answer

- Can historical market data be grouped into distinct behavioral regimes?
- How does volatility evolve before market stress events?
- How do simple models and strategies behave across regimes?
- When do predictive models fail, and why?

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

This system reflects how:
- Financial institutions analyze risk
- Hedge funds perform regime-aware modeling
- Regulators study market stress

The focus is on **understanding uncertainty**, not short-term trading.
