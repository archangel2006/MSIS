# MSIS Streamlit Dashboard

## Overview
The Streamlit dashboard provides an interactive frontend for the **Market Shock Intelligence System (MSIS)**.

It visualizes market regimes detected using an unsupervised learning model (KMeans) applied to S&P 500 data.

---

## What the Dashboard Shows

Each market regime is characterized using three financial indicators:

- **Return**: Daily price change (direction of movement)
- **Volatility**: Degree of price fluctuation (risk)
- **Drawdown**: Loss from the most recent market peak

These indicators help explain *why* a particular day belongs to a specific market regime.

## Market Regimes

| Regime | Description |
|------|------------|
| Stable / Sideways | Low volatility, shallow drawdowns |
| Normal Trending | Moderate volatility, positive trends |
| Crisis / High-Risk | High volatility, deep drawdowns |

---

## Architecture

The dashboard fetches regime data from the MSIS FastAPI backend, which serves predictions generated by the KMeans model.

## How Streamlit Talks to FastAPI

The Streamlit app sends an HTTP GET request to the FastAPI backend:

```python
response = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:8000/regimes")

> FastAPI returns market regime data as JSON, which Streamlit converts into a Pandas DataFrame for visualization.

## How to Run

1. Start Backend
```
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

2. Start Frontend
```
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

# Purpose

This dashboard demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used to:

- Detect hidden market conditions
- Explain market risk visually
- Support regime-aware decision making
